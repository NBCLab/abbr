Abstract:
OCD (OCD) can be studied applying neurocomputational method by attractor network modeling approach. OCD are typically characterized by repetitive task or, checking something frequently in fear of something wrong will happen. These phenomenons are explained by attractor basin of neuronal network state and theory suggests network energy state goes deep in the attractor basin so that it cannot come out of it when other stimulus is given. Integrate and Fire (INF) model suggests an increase in the NMDA and/or AMPA receptor conductance, as well as over activity in glutamate transmitter can be blamed for OCD phenomenon, and increase in GABA counterbalances the effect.
Introduction:
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by two sets of symptoms: obsessive and compulsive. Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive, recurrent thoughts or impulses and compulsions are ritualistic, repetitive behaviors or compulsions are ritualistic, repetitive behavior or mental acts carried out in relation to obsessions 1. These symptoms are correlated with over stability of attractor neuronal networks in cortical and related areas. The phenomenon is explained by over activity in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmitter synapses, also demonstrated during INF (INF) network simulations altering glutamatergic transmitter systems 2.  The attractor network framework is based on dynamical systems theory and different pattern of attractor is associated with different biological functions such as memory 3. A pattern activated by an input is then stably maintained by the system even after input offset 4,5. Integrate and fire simulations (INF) were performed to demonstrate the stability of attractor network brought about by creating condition similar to the alteration of glutamate as a synaptic transmitter and tendency of attractor to stay in current basin or, jump to out of it was studied in number of trials 2. The simulation architecture includes equivalent neural network having channel activated by AMPA,NMDA and GABAA receptors and simulates spiking and noise activities 2,6. Spiking relating noise is used to analyze if an attractor stays in current basin of attraction or jumps over an energy barrier into another basin (Loh et al., 2007). The paper aims to study the relation of changes in AMPA, NMDA, and GABAA receptor current with the OCD symptoms.
Attractor Network Model
An attractor network is a network of neurons often recurrently connected, whose time dynamics settle to a stable pattern which can be stationary, cyclic, stochastic etc 3. Different pattern of attractor is associated with different biological functions such as memory, and over time it tends toward one of the set of predefined states on dimension referred as stability 3. Experiments performed on animal suggests higher firing rate in neurons in case of memory and other related cognitive functions. Attractor network models have been proposed to explain the activity which is coexistence between a non-selective attractor states with low background activity with selective attractor states where neuron fires at higher rates7. The simplified architecture of an attractor network can be explained by below figure 1.
Fig 1: Schematic diagram of Attractor Network Model
The external input ei activate the neurons in the network, and produce firing yi, where i is  ith  neurons, which are connected to each other by recurrent collateral synapses wij, where j is the jth synapse on a neuron. There is positive feedback implemented via the recurrent collateral connections, the network can sustain persistent firing8. The recall state and the moving to next sequence can be shown as energy landscape where energy is defined by equation 1 (Figure 2). Input is received from the pyramidal cells, and makes inhibitory negative feedback connections onto the pyramidal cells to keep their activity under control. Hopfield (1982) showed that the recall state in a simple attractor network can be thought of as the local minimum in an energy landscape, where the energy would be defined equation 1.
Fig 2: Energy landscape representation for attractor network state
The minima of the energy basin as shown in figure 2, shows the energy in spontaneous state (left) with low firing rate and right is energy basin of high firing rate attractor state, and as the minimal point of energy (right) becomes deeper, it becomes persistent and continues firing, which leads over stable state and also makes condition favorable for OCD 4. In neurochemical terms, the over stability is caused by example over activity in glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmitter synapses, which is observed during INF (INF) network simulations altering glutamatergic transmitter systems 4. These higher firing rates can occur in different region of brain creating over stability in different region, and it creates different types of OCD. For example, if it occurs in motor area, then it makes hard to move from one motor state, and the person displays repeated action. Likewise, if it occurs in lateral prefrontal cortex then the outcome may be difficulty in shifting attention and in cognitive set shifting.  Further study suggests obsession states may occur because of cortical areas being concerned with cognitive functions and having too stable states and compulsive states in response to the obsession states 4. Integrate and Fire (INF) model was used to demonstrate stability of attractor network to explain OCD phenomenon.
Alteration of Gutamatergic transmitter systems using INF Model
In simplified single cell Integrate and Fire model, an isolated neuron is simulated by external current and can be represented by simple resistor-capacitor circuit. However, in realistic situation, input current is generated by the activity of presynaptic neurons, which is applied in integrate and fire model and is basically part of larger network8. Various studies use INF simulation to find the effect of alteration of glutamatergic transmitter on the depth of attractor basins of cortical and related attractor networks. The current equivalent to that produced by activation of NMDA, AMPA, and GABA receptors in recurrent collateral synapses is simulated and corresponding spike-noise relation was studied 2,8. One of the architecture includes single attractor or, auto association network with 400 excitatory and 100 inhibitory neurons, and connection strengths adjusted using mean-field analysis so that excitatory and inhibitory neurons exhibit a spontaneous activity of 3 Hz and 9 Hz, respectively. When neuron receives no synaptic input, membrane potential of neuron goes down to resting potential, and excitatory neurons transmit their action potentials via the AMPA and NMDA glutamatergic receptors which produces exponentially decaying currents in the postsynaptic neuron 2.
In above model, to analyze the shift of attractor state with lower depth and higher depth, cortical network model is developed consisting of selective pools of S1 and S2 represented as short term memory and respectively. The non-selective pool NS models the spiking of cortical neurons and inhibitory pool IH contains the 100 inhibitory neurons. The connection weight is set up using mean field analysis such that S1 and S2 have stable attractor (Figure 3). The input is the Poisson input spikes via AMPA receptors which originate from 800 external neurons with average spontaneous firing rate of 3 Hz from, W+ represents intrapool connection between neuron of selective pool and W- excitory connections, which counter balance the increased w+. Three different conditions: the spontaneous, persistent, and distracter is simulated using the model as shown in table 1 2.
It was observed that very small increases in the synaptic currents modified the global behavior of the network i.e. stability of its attractors. Alteration of NMDA, AMPA and GABA synapses to different percentage and their corresponding impact on attractor state were simulated in above experiment. The result was alteration of NMDA, AMPA and GABA synapses by 3%, 10%, and 10% respectively were sufficient to alter the stability of the attractor network. Multiple trials in INF simulation shows for spontaneous state, the network was unstable on 10% of the trial. For the persistent run simulations, where cue triggered initial higher firing rate attractor state, the network was still in the high firing rate attractor state in the baseline condition on approximately 88% of the runs, and that this had increased to 98% when the NMDA conductance’s were increased by 3% (+NMDA). Also, only increasing AMPA by 10% increased the stability of the persistent high firing rate attractor state as did the combination +NMDA+AMPA.
It implies increasing the NMDA receptor-activated synaptic currents increased the stability of the network and can be linked to network jumping silent state of spontaneous activity into a high firing rate attractor state (very stable state), thereby producing symptoms of OCD. Also, the simulation found that increasing GABA (+GABA) corrected for the network state to reach to persistent state. It implies, agents that increase GABA in brain cells may reduce the tendency to remain in high attractor state and locked in an idea or, concern 2, 9.
Conclusion
OCD are characterized by one’s tendency to be locked into an idea or, concern, and almost impossible to move out of it. The phenomenon is explained by attractor basin energy theory, where the attractor state goes to deep in the basin such that when next simulation is presented, it does not get out of it. Attractor Network model and Integrate and Fire Simulation (INF) is applied to study the characteristics of OCD symptoms. One of the study includes simplified leaky INF simulation model created using single attractor or, auto association network with 400 excitatory and 100 inhibitory neurons, and sending Poisson spike input of 3Hz, and NMDA, AMPA and GABA synapses current altered to simulate the spontaneous, persistent, and distracter condition. The result showed increase in NMDA, AMPA synapses currents lead to persistent and distracter state, which further lead to symptoms of OCD, where as increases in GABA synapse current counter balanced the tendency of higher firing rate that lead to very stable attractor state. It implies, agents that increase GABA in brain cells may reduce the symptoms of OCD, however in-depth analysis and experiment is required to validate the hypothesis.
