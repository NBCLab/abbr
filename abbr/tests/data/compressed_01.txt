In 2013, 17.8% of the American adult population was addicted to cigarettes (CDC, 2015). While the prevalence of cigarette smoking has decreased significantly since previous decades, the quit rate among current smokers still remains very low. Of the smokers attempting to quit within a given year (52%), only about 6% achieve sustained cessation (CDC, 2011). Currently available pharmacotherapies aiding smoking cessation, including nicotine replacement therapy and the antidepressant bupropion, are only modestly effective, doubling the quit rate compared to placebos (Rollema et al., 2007a). Varnencline, the drug commercially used in Chantix, has emerged as a promising pharmacotherapy. However, its physiological mechanisms in humans are still not completely understood.
Preclinical studies on human addiction pathology mechanisms are needed to efficiently develop and refine drugs aiding nicotine cessation (Lerman et al., 2007). Neuroimaging research identifying brain activity associated with nicotine withdrawal will point to appropriate physiological targets for pharmacological interventions. While the elevated rewarding properties of addictive drugs, like nicotine have been shown to motivate continued consumption (Volkow et al., 2010), it can be argued that nicotine withdrawal symptoms are the main barriers to smoking cessation (Baker, Brandon & Chassin, 2004). The negative reinforcement model of drug addiction suggests that escape or avoidance of physical, and affective withdrawal symptoms is the main driver of continuing drug use in addicts (Baker, Brandon & Chassin, 2004). Accordingly, pharmacological, smoking cessation aids must address both the avoidance of withdrawal states, in addition to the over-selection of drug obtaining actions. This review will describe various regions, neurotransmitter pathways, and network connectivity patterns linked to smoking withdrawal symptoms and both sides of reward processing deficits. This information will be used to argue for pharmacological targeting of particular, implicated neural circuitries.
Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms and Associated Neurological Alterations
Most nicotine withdrawal symptoms begin within the first week of smoking abstinence and can continue for two to four weeks (Hughes, 2007). These withdrawal symptoms can be broken down into categories including: negative affect, physiological conditions, cigarette craving, cognitive deficits and reward processing deficits. While many of these symptoms co-occur and interact with each other, attempting to separate symptoms and identify their respective neural substrates will allow for more precise and individualized treatment options (Lerman et al., 2007).
Negative affective symptoms can ensue following just a few hours of smoking withdrawal (Hughes, 2007). Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers (2002) demonstrated, through the use of the Withdrawal Symptom Checklist (Hughes & Hatsukami, 1986), that smokers reported greater anxiety, depression, anger, irritability and impatience, during abstinence from cigarettes. Smokers also reported being less calm and less content during a nicotine withdrawal state relative to their reports during an ad libitum smoking condition. Physical symptoms of smoking withdrawal, include, increased appetite, weight gain, constipation, cough, dizziness, mouth ulcers and insomnia (Hughes, 2007).
Increased amygdala activation during withdrawal via the CRF (CRF) system is a likely contributor to these negative affective withdrawal symptoms (Koob & Le Moal, 2005). The CRF system in the amygdala is recruited during excessive drug taking and is particularly slow to return to homeostasis after terminating drug use (Koob, 2003); (Koob & Le Moal, 2005). During withdrawal, this increased extracellular CRF in the extended amygdala is maintained and contributes to subjective experiences of anxiety and stress-like states. Other neurotransmitter systems, including norepinephrine and dynorphin, are similarly recruited during excessive drug taking and produce anxiety when the drug is removed (Koob & Le Moal, 2005). In addition neuropeptide Y, that has naturally anxiolytic properties, exhibits decreased activity in the amygdala, during withdrawal states (Koob, 2003).
The insular part of the salience network and its circuit-level interactions are hypothesized to track homeostatically relevant bodily sensations during early nicotine abstinence (Craig, 2010); (Paulus, Tapert, & Schulteis, 2009); (Naqvi & Bechara, 2009). Elevations in amygdala-insula and insula–default-mode network interactions are thought to be involved in attention toward aversive, nicotine withdrawal symptoms in abstinent smokers and have shown to predict withdrawal-induced cognitive deficits, craving and relapse (Lerman et al., 2007); (Sutherland et al., 2012, 2013). This increased connectivity of the salience network with the default mode network distracts from external tasks by biasing attention toward internal withdrawal symptoms (Sutherland et al., 2012, 2013).
Craving for cigarettes is a very prominent nicotine withdrawal symptom, particularly in response to some sort of smoking cue (eg. Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers, 2002). The extended visual system, precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and dorsal striatum are reliably activated in smokers in response to smoking cues. Parts of the extended visual system and dorsal prefrontal cortex are more reliably responsive to smoking cues in deprived smokers than in non-deprived smokers (Engelmann et al., 2012). Greater resting state cerebral blood flow in the right OFC, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, ACC, VS/nucleus accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, left caudate, and right insula during smoking abstinence vs. smoking satiety predicted abstinence induced craving to smoke (Wang et al., 2007). Smokers who relapsed after attempting to quit had greater reactivity to smoking related cues in the amygdala, bilateral insula, ACC, posterior cingulate cortex, primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, inferior parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, putamen, cerebellar hemispheres and vermis relative to a group of smokers who were able to maintain abstinence (Janes et al., 2010). Consequently, cue reactivity in these areas is associated with difficulties in smoking cessation.
The cognitive impairments observed in abstinent smokers may also be attributed to the, before mentioned, attentional bias toward aversive internal states and the distraction from external task attention (Lerman et al., 2007); (Sutherland et al., 2012, 2013). Various sensory, attentional and motor (finger tapping) abilities are impaired in abstinent smokers compared to an ad lithium smoking condition (Heishman, Taylor & Henningfield, 1994). Smokers experiencing nicotine withdrawal have displayed worse cognitive performance on arithmetic tasks commonly used to measure attention, concentration, working memory and processing speed (Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers, 2002). Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers (2002) confirmed that habitual cigarette smokers experiencing 18 hours of smoking abstinence showed greater maximum blood pressure in response to behavioral challenges than they displayed in an ad libitum condition. Concentration difficulties and drowsiness have also been linked to nicotine withdrawal (Hughes, 2007); (Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers, 2002). These cognitive impairments are associated with decreased functional connectivity between the salience network and the executive function network (Sutherland et al., 2013). Abstinent smokers also regularly display decreased executive function network activation (bilateral dorsolateral PFC and medial frontal/cingulate gyrus) during working memory tasks (eg. Falcone et al., 2014).
Research has shown that these neurologically manifested, affective, physical and cognitive impairments during nicotine withdrawal can all be reversed by reverting back to nicotine use (Hughes, 2007); (Al'Absi, Amunrud & Wittmers, 2002). Because smoking relapse provides relief from physical and affective discomforts, in addition to reversing cognitive impairments, negative reinforcement mechanisms maintain smoking even when an individual expresses a desire to quit. This avoidance of withdrawal symptoms coupled with increased motivation for drug rewards makes withdrawal-induced alterations in the reward processing system particularly important when attempting to understand the mechanisms leading to smoking relapse.
Reward Processing
Reward processing influences reinforcement learning through dopaminergic signaling mechanisms. In a normally functioning reward processing system, actions are selected to maximize future reward by calculating a value function of the reward (Reddish, 2004). The value of the reward is calculated by deducting the expected, future reward by the expected wait-time until the reward (Reddish, 2004). An individual is hypothesized to predict the time to the reward via dopamine-signaled reward prediction errors (Reddish, 2004). Dopamine signaling in the mesocorticolimbic system is thought to discriminate between the expected outcome and the actual outcome (Dani, 2003). Recognizing incongruence between the actual and predicted outcome is the mechanism by which reinforcement learning happens (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972); (Redish, 2004). This reward learning process is vital for everyday functioning and survival because the way rewards are valued and predicted determines how behaviors are selected (McClure, York & Montague, 2004).
Reward processing dysregulation in chronic smokers. The reward processing mechanisms of dependent cigarette smokers’ have been dysregulated by quick and unnaturally large surges of dopamine that over-prioritize cigarette-acquiring, goal directed behaviors (Volkow et al., 2010). Dependent cigarette smokers display decreased motivation for, and pleasure from, non-drug related positive outcomes (Martin-Solch et al., 2001). They also display hyperresponsive VS (VS) activity in anticipation of drug rewards (David et al., 2005) and hyporesponsive VS activity in anticipation of non-drug rewards (Peters et al., 2011). This reduced VS activation to non-drug rewards is correlated with smoking frequency (Peters et al., 2011). Human imaging studies of addicts have uncovered a potential mechanism leading to these activation changes. Decreased dopamine D2 receptors in addicts contribute to decreased dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area pathway projecting to the VS/nucleus accumbens and extended amygdala (Koob & Le Moal, 2005).
Bühler et al., (2009) demonstrated that alterations in VS responses are associated with the observed imbalanced selection of reward-seeking actions. The non-dependent smokers’ higher motivation for the monetary rewards than the cigarette rewards was mirrored by increased activation during anticipation of monetary rewards vs. cigarette rewards in the inferior orbitofrontal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, ACC, globus pallidus, caudate, putamen, and VS (Bühler et al., 2009). Dependent smokers had the same activation response to monetary reward cues as they had in response to cigarette reward cues, which was associated with their increased motivation for the drug rewards and decreased motivation for the monetary rewards compared to the non-dependent smokers (Bühler et al., 2009).
Because abstinent smokers are less responsive to non-drug rewards and have stopped receiving drug rewards, withdrawal can be thought of as continual omission of expected-rewards (Balodis & Potenza, 2015). This state of reward omission is characterized by a hypersensitivity to negative outcomes specifically, anhedonia, anxiety, irritability and the other aversive symptoms that were described previously (Volkow et al., 2010). These negative, withdrawal symptoms exacerbate inappropriate action selection following maladaptive drug prioritization (Baker, Brandon & Chassin, 2004); (Volkow et al., 2010).
Future research should explore the multiple reward processing mechanisms that are modified in the early stages of withdrawal. Alterations in the way positive and negative outcomes are predicted and anticipated have shown to compromise abilities to select between courses of action (Bühler et al., 2009). Smokers experiencing withdrawal have, indeed, displayed changes in brain activation following positive outcomes in reward-processing tasks (Balodis & Potenza, 2015). However, hypersensitivity of brain areas associated with exposure to negative outcomes may underlie relapse-motiving, aversive states of reward omission. Understanding the neuro-circuitry underlying negative responses to omission of expected rewards will help identify methods to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms. Accordingly, future research should investigate divergent activity patterns to negative outcomes in individuals experiencing nicotine withdrawal.
Directions for Future Research
Habenula and nicotine withdrawal. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have begun to identify negative-outcome-processing regions in the general population. The rostral cingulate motor area, inferior-anterior insula, and habenular complex are all activated following negative feedback (Ullsperger & Cramon, 2003). The habenula is a small nucleus located posterior to the thalamus and adjacent to the third ventricle and may be a particularly important region in reward processing changes occurring during nicotine withdrawal. When an expected reward is missed, increased activity in the LHb (LHb) precedes decreased activity in the VTA/SN (VTA/SN), suggesting a signal from the LHb is sent to the VTA/SN (Ide & Li, 2011). Habenula activation is known to inactivate dopaminergic cells in the midbrain via the fasciculus retroflexus output pathway (Velasquez, Molfese & Salas, 2014). In this pathway, the habenula regulates glutamatergic excitation of gabaergic cells in the RMTg (RMTg). This GABA release in the RMTg inhibits dopamine release in the VTA/SN, which leads to decreased dopamine signaling in the VS (Velasquez, Molfese & Salas, 2014). Using Granger causality and mediation analyses, Ide and Li, (2011) established that the habenula also mediates functional connectivity between the amygdala and VTA/SN following reward prediction errors.
In addition to the habenula’s involvement in this reward processing circuit, it is densely packed with nAChR (nAChR) and has been functionally linked to nicotine self-administration (Picciotto et al., 1998); (Fowler et al., 2011), and nicotine aversion (Frahm et al., 2011). The habenula’s medial subsection (MHb) mediates nicotine withdrawal symptoms in mice (Salas et al., 2009), and its lateral subsection (LHb) is involved in reward learning (Salas et al., 2010); (Matsumoto & Hikosaka, 2007). Studies of divergent habenula activation to negative outcomes during nicotine withdrawal would be beneficial for understanding withdrawal symptoms and the amelioration mechanisms of pharmacological interventions, particularly ones that act on nAChRs.
Neural mechanisms of nAChR drug interventions. Nicotine administration, often via nicotine patches, has been regularly used as a smoking cessation therapy (Tiffany, Cox & Elash, 2000). Nicotine’s marginal effectiveness in aiding smoking cessation provides further evidence that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms is perpetuating smoking. Varenicline is also used commercially as a smoking cessation aid and has proven to be even more effective (Fedota et al., 2015). By acting as a dual-action partial-agonist/antagonist to nAChRs (Sutherland et al., 2013), varenicline is able to decrease the subjective reinforcing nature of nicotine relapse (Patterson et al., 2009). In nicotine’s absence, varenicline acts as a partial agonist to the a4b2 nAChR, producing about 50% of nicotine’s relative receptor binding (Rollema et al., 2007b). Conversely, in nicotine’s presence, varenicline prevents nicotine’s binding by acting as an antagonist, with a higher affinity for the receptor (Rollema et al., 2007b). Varenicline’s dual action has shown to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms, while also diminishing nicotine-induced pharmacologic effects following re-exposure (Rollema et al., 2007a).
While most of the information about varenicline’s neural mechanisms has been provided by animal research, some emerging fMRI research is beginning to offer more precise localization of the human, neural-circuitry regulated by varenicline. For example, Sutherland et al. (2013) demonstrated that resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala-insula circuit is down-regulated by both varenicline and nicotine in abstinent smokers. Future studies should continue to explore varenicline’s neural mechanisms in humans. The habenula is another likely target region of both varenicline and nicotine due to its high density of nAChRs that are known to be necessary for nicotine self-administration, addiction and withdrawal in mice (Gorlich et al., 2013); (Salas et al., 2003, 2004, 2009).
Conclusions. Dependent smokers attempting to quit are being hindered by both the avoidance of negative withdrawal symptoms and the heightened valuation of, and motivation for, cigarette rewards. If pharmacological therapies can target neural mechanisms associated with impairments in these two sides of reward processing, they will more effectively promote smoking cessation. Evidence has shown that varenicline’s dual action profile makes it able to address both withdrawal avoidance and nicotine craving (Patterson et al., 2009). Identifying the brain areas varenicline is acting on and understanding the role they play in reward processing will inform the development of enhanced, addiction-ameliorating drugs and other forms of addiction therapies. Altered habenular responses to negative outcomes in abstinent smokers is a promising direction for future research attempting to better understand the neural substrates of the negative reinforcement mechanisms perpetuating smoking.
